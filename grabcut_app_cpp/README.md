# GrabCutTool

GrabCut GUI using C++

Implements a GrabCut GUI in two stages: 1) simple GUI from OpenCV builtins and 2) interface of methods to set as callbacks for the GUI.

This allows the GUI to be quickly swapped, e.g. into something more advanced like Qt (the goal for this tool) in a very streamlined way.
